# Welcome to my Portfolio!

The project is to develop my portfolio, with professional and personal information, showing my knowledge, my academic background and my built projects, as well as my personal qualities.


## Project details:
The project is developed with technologies such as JavaScript, React js and consuming the Email.js API. 

It consists of 5 sections, the first one is a presentation banner in which besides my personal photo, and a button to change the background color, there are 4 buttons with redirection to the other 4 sections. The first CV, shows my academic qualifications, skills, knowledge and languages. The second one, my completed projects. As for the third one, the idea is to talk a little about myself by commenting on a presentation and my personal interests. Also, in the last section there is a contact form so that any person/company can send me a message by mail with their respective data. Finally, at the bottom of the page you will find my networks in case you wish to contact me through them.
